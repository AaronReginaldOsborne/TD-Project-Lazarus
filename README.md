# TD-Project-Lazarus

The challenge of this project was to design an android application revolving around Augmented Reality. We created a foreclose listing to allow customers to see a layout of the building and also go inside for a virtual reality tour. The information is easily filtered and sorted through custom chosen categories such as Homes, Buildings, Landscape, Markets, and Storage. We used a list view to show all the properties that TD currently owns. Also a map view for showing the distance from your current location to each destination.
